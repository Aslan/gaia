What is Gaia ?
====

In Greek mythology, Gaia is the personification of the Earth and one of the Greek primordial deities. Gaia is the ancestral mother of all life: the primal Mother Earth goddess.

More seriously, Gaia is just a wrapper script for [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/). Terraform is a fantastic tool to bring infrastructure as code, but running Terraform in automation 
is sometimes tedious. That's why we develop this very lean bash script just to wrap Terraform calls and to add some new cool features not built-in.

## Motivation

There's a lot of alternative like [Terragrunt](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt)
